# Notification Service Documentation

Each service needs to create two documents.

1. [Definition document](./01-definition.md): This document is used to describe the service, its operations, its NFRs,
   and observability details.
2. [Design document](./02-design.md): This document is used to detail out implementation details. The implementation
   details include OpenAPI document, sequence diagrams, domain model, and important business logic.

There are two directories:

1. [diagrams](./diagrams): This directory is used to store Draw.io diagrams that you will draw while creating design
   document.
2. [images](./images): This directory is used to store images that will be used by documents in JPEG or PNG format.
